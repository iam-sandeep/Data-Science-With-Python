Timezones in Pandas
Earlier in this course, you assigned a timezone to each datetime in a list. Now with Pandas you can do that with a single method call.

(Note that, just as before, your data set actually includes some ambiguous datetimes on account of daylight saving; for now, we'll tell Pandas to not even try on those ones. Figuring them out would require more work.)
