Comparing a histogram and distplot
The pandas library supports simple plotting of data, which is very convenient when data is already likely to be in a pandas DataFrame.


Seaborn generally does more statistical analysis on data and can provide more sophisticated insight into the data. In this exercise, we will compare a pandas histogram vs the seaborn distplot.

'''
# Display pandas histogram
df['Award_Amount'].plot.hist()
plt.show()

# Clear out the pandas histogram
plt.clf()

# Display a Seaborn distplot
sns.distplot(df['Award_Amount'])
plt.show()

# Clear the distplot
plt.clf()
