Filter
In the previous exercise, you computed the mean birth weight for full-term babies; you filtered out preterm babies because their distribution of weight is different.

The distribution of weight is also different for multiple births, like twins and triplets. In this exercise, you'll filter them out, too, and see what effect it has on the mean.

full_term = nsfg['prglngth'] >= 37

single_full_term_weight = birth_weight[single & full_term]

# Compute birth weight for multiple full-term babies
mult_full_term_weight = birth_weight[~single & full_term]
