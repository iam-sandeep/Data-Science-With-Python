PMF of age
Do people tend to gain weight as they get older? We can answer this question by visualizing the relationship between weight and age. But before we make a scatter plot, it is a good idea to visualize distributions one variable at a time. Here, you'll visualize age using a bar chart first. Recall that all PMF objects have a .bar() method to make a bar chart.

The BRFSS dataset includes a variable, 'AGE' (note the capitalization!), which represents each respondent's age. To protect respondents' privacy, ages are rounded off into 5-year bins. 'AGE' contains the midpoint of the bins.


'''
# Extract AGE
age = brfss['AGE']

# Plot the PMF
pmf_age = Pmf(age)
pmf_age.bar()

# Label the axes
plt.xlabel('Age in years')
plt.ylabel('PMF')
plt.show()

'''
Scatter plot
Now let's make a scatterplot of weight versus age. To make the code run faster, I've selected only the first 1000 rows from the brfss DataFrame.

weight and age have already been extracted for you. Your job is to use plt.plot() to make a scatter plot.

'''
# Select the first 1000 respondents
brfss = brfss[:1000]

# Extract age and weight
age = brfss['AGE']
weight = brfss['WTKG3']

# Make a scatter plot
plt.plot(age, weight, 'o', alpha=0.1)

plt.xlabel('Age in years')
plt.ylabel('Weight in kg')

plt.show()



'''
Jittering
In the previous exercise, the ages fall in columns because they've been rounded into 5-year bins. If we jitter them, the scatter plot will show the relationship more clearly. Recall how Allen jittered height and weight in the video:

'''
# Select the first 1000 respondents
brfss = brfss[:1000]

# Add jittering to age
age = brfss['AGE'] + np.random.normal(0, 2.5, size=len(brfss))
# Extract weight
weight = brfss['WTKG3']

# Make a scatter plot
plt.plot(age, weight, 'o', markersize=5, alpha=0.2)

plt.xlabel('Age in years')
plt.ylabel('Weight in kg')
plt.show()
