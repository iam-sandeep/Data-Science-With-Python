This chapter focuses on a popular clustering algorithm -
 hierarchical clustering - and its implementation in SciPy. 
 In addition to the procedure to perform hierarchical clustering, 
 it attempts to help you answer an important question - how many 
 clusters are present in your data? The chapter concludes with a 
 discussion on the limitations of hierarchical clustering and discusses 
 considerations while using hierarchical clustering.
