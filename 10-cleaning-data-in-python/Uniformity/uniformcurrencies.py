Uniform currencies
In this exercise and throughout this chapter, you will be working with a retail banking dataset stored in the banking DataFrame. The dataset contains data on the amount of money stored in accounts, their currency, amount invested, account opening date and last transaction date that were consolidated from American and European branches.

You are tasked with understanding the average account size and how investments vary by the size of account, however in order to produce this analysis accurately, you first need to unify the currency amount into dollars. The pandas package has been imported as pd, and the banking DataFrame is in your environment.

'''
# Find values of acct_cur that are equal to 'euro'
acct_eu = banking['acct_cur'] == 'euro'

# Convert acct_amount where it is in euro to dollars
banking.loc[acct_eu, 'acct_amount'] = banking.loc[acct_eu, 'acct_amount'] * 1.1 

# Unify acct_cur column by changing 'euro' values to 'dollar'
banking.loc[acct_eu, 'acct_cur'] = 'dollar'

# Assert that only dollar currency remains
assert banking['acct_cur'].unique() == 'dollar'


'''
Uniform dates
After having unified the currencies of your different account amounts, you want to add a temporal dimension to your analysis and see how customers have been investing their money given the size of their account over each year. The account_opened column represents when customers opened their accounts and is a good proxy for segmenting customer activity and investment over time.

However, since this data was consolidated from multiple sources, you need to make sure that all dates are of the same format. You will do so by converting this column into a datetime object, while making sure that the format is inferred and potentially incorrect formats are set to missing. The banking DataFrame is in your environment and pandas was imported as pd.
