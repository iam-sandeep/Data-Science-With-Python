Linking them together!
In the last lesson, you've finished the bulk of the work on your effort to link restaurants and restaurants_new. You've generated the different pairs of potentially matching rows, searched for exact matches between the cuisine_type and city columns, but compared for similar strings in the rest_name column. You stored the DataFrame containing the scores in potential_matches.

Now it's finally time to link both DataFrames. You will do so by first extracting all row indices of restaurants_new that are matching across the columns mentioned above from potential_matches. Then you will subset restaurants_new on these indices, then append the non-duplicate values to restaurants. All DataFrames are in your environment, alongside pandas imported as pd.

# Isolate potential matches with row sum >=3
matches = potential_matches[potential_matches.sum(axis = 1) >= 3]

# Get values of second column index of matches
matching_indices = matches.index.get_level_values(1)

# Subset restaurants_new based on non-duplicate values
non_dup = restaurants_new[~restaurants_new.index.isin(matching_indices)]

# Append non_dup to restaurants
full_restaurants = restaurants.append(non_dup)
print(full_restaurants)
