Inner joins and number of rows returned
All of the merges you have studied to this point are called
 inner joins. It is necessary to understand that inner joins only return the rows 
 with matching values in both tables.


ONe to many Relationship

with a one-to-many relationship, a row in the left table may be repeated if 
it is related to multiple rows in the right table.


Enriching a dataset
Setting how='left' with the .merge()method is a useful technique for enriching or
 enhancing a dataset with additional information from a different table.


Using outer join to select actors

One cool aspect of using an outer join is that, because it returns all
 rows from both merged tables and null where they do not match, 
you can use it to find rows that do not have a match in the other table.

Concatenation basics


You have been given a few tables of data with musical
 track info for different albums from the metal band, Metallica. 
 The track info comes from their Ride The Lightning, Master Of Puppets, and St. 
 Anger albums. Try various features of the .concat() method by concatenating the tables vertically together in different ways.

The tables tracks_master, tracks_ride, and tracks_st have loaded for you.
'''

#Concatenate tracks_master, tracks_ride,
# and tracks_st, in that order, setting sort to True.

 # Concatenate the tracks
tracks_from_albums = pd.concat([tracks_master, tracks_ride, tracks_st], 
                               sort=True)
print(tracks_from_albums)


#Concatenate tracks_master, 
#tracks_ride, and tracks_st, where the index goes from 0 to n-1.

# Concatenate the tracks so the index goes from 0 to n-1
tracks_from_albums = pd.concat([tracks_master, tracks_ride, tracks_st],
                               ignore_index=True,
                               sort=True)
print(tracks_from_albums)


#Concatenate tracks_master,
 #tracks_ride, and tracks_st, showing only columns that are in all tables.

 # Concatenate the tracks, show only columns names that are in all tables
tracks_from_albums = pd.concat([tracks_master, tracks_ride, tracks_st],
                               join='inner',
                               sort=True)

Concatenating with keys
The leadership of the music streaming company has come to you and asked you for assistance in analyzing sales for a recent business quarter. They would like to know which month in the quarter saw the highest average invoice total. You have been given three tables with invoice data named inv_jul, inv_aug, and inv_sep. 
Concatenate these tables into one to create a graph of the average monthly invoice total.
"""
"""
Concatenate the three tables together vertically in order with the oldest month first, adding '7Jul', '8Aug', and '9Sep' as keys for their respective months, and save to variable avg_inv_by_month.
Use the .agg() method to find the average of the total column from the grouped invoices.
Create a bar chart of avg_inv_by_month.
"""
# Concatenate the tables and add keys
inv_jul_thr_sep = pd.concat([inv_jul, inv_aug, inv_sep], 
                            keys=['7Jul','8Aug','9Sep'])

# Group the invoices by the index keys and find avg of the total column
avg_inv_by_month = inv_jul_thr_sep.groupby(level=0).agg({'total':'mean'})

# Bar plot of avg_inv_by_month
avg_inv_by_month.plot(kind='bar')
plt.show()

'''
Using the append method
The .concat() method is excellent when you need a lot of control over how concatenation is performed. However, if you do not need as much control, then the .append() method is another option. You'll try this method out by appending the track lists together from different Metallica albums. From there, you will merge it with the invoice_items table to determine which track sold the most.

The tables tracks_master, tracks_ride, tracks_st, and invoice_items have loaded for you.

Task
Use the .append() method to combine (in this order)tracks_ride, tracks_master, and tracks_st together vertically, and save to metallica_tracks.
Merge metallica_tracks and invoice_items on tid with an inner join, and save to tracks_invoices.
For each tid and name in tracks_invoices, sum the quantity sold column, and save as tracks_sold.
Sort tracks_sold in descending order by the quantity column, and print the table.

'''
# Use the .append() method to combine the tracks tables
metallica_tracks = tracks_ride.append([tracks_master, tracks_st], sort=False)

# Merge metallica_tracks and invoice_items
tracks_invoices = metallica_tracks.merge(invoice_items, on='tid')

# For each tid and name sum the quantity sold
tracks_sold = tracks_invoices.groupby(['tid','name']).agg({'quantity':'sum'})

# Sort in decending order by quantity and print the results
print(tracks_sold.sort_values(['quantity'], ascending=False))

Concatenate and merge to find common songs
The senior leadership of the streaming service is
 requesting your help again. You are given the historical 
 files for a popular playlist in the classical music genre in 2018 and 2019.
  Additionally, you are given a similar set of files for the most popular pop
   music genre playlist on the streaming service in 2018 and 2019. Your goal is 
   to concatenate the respective files to make a large classical playlist table 
   and overall popular music table. Then filter the classical music table using a
    semi-join to return only the most popular classical music tracks.
