Evaluate individual classifiers
In this exercise you'll evaluate the performance of the models in the list classifiers that we defined in the previous exercise. You'll do so by fitting each classifier on the training set and evaluating its test set accuracy.

The dataset is already loaded and preprocessed for you (numerical features are standardized) and it is split into 70% train and 30% test. The features matrices X_train and X_test, as well as the arrays of labels y_train and y_test are available in your workspace. In addition, we have loaded the list classifiers from the previous exercise, as well as the function accuracy_score() from sklearn.metrics.

# Iterate over the pre-defined list of classifiers
for clf_name, clf in classifiers:    
 
    # Fit clf to the training set
    clf.fit(X_train, y_train)    
   
    # Predict y_pred
    y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
    
    # Calculate accuracy
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_pred, y_test) 
   
    # Evaluate clf's accuracy on the test set
    print('{:s} : {:.3f}'.format(clf_name, accuracy))
