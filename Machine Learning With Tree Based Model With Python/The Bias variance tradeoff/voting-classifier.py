Better performance with a Voting Classifier
Finally, you'll evaluate the performance of a voting classifier that takes 
the outputs of the models defined 
in the list classifiers and assigns labels by majority voting.

X_train, X_test,y_train, y_test, the list classifiers defined in a 
previous exercise, as well as the function accuracy_score from sklearn.metrics
 are available in your workspace.

# Import VotingClassifier from sklearn.ensemble
from sklearn.ensemble import VotingClassifier

# Instantiate a VotingClassifier vc
vc = VotingClassifier(estimators=classifiers)     

# Fit vc to the training set
vc.fit(X_train, y_train)   

# Evaluate the test set predictions
y_pred = vc.predict(X_test)

# Calculate accuracy score
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_pred, y_test)
print('Voting Classifier: {:.3f}'.format(accuracy))
