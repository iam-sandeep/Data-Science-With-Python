Stacked bar chart
A stacked bar chart contains bars, where the height of each bar represents values.
 In addition, stacked on top of the first variable may be another variable. 
 The additional height of this bar represents the value of this variable. 
 And you can add more bars on top of that.

# Stack bars for "Bronze" on top of that with label "Bronze"

Creating boxplots
Boxplots provide additional information about the distribution of the data that they represent. They tell us what the median of the distribution is, what the inter-quartile range is and also what the expected range of approximately 99% of the data should be. Outliers beyond this range are particularly highlighted.

fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Add a boxplot for the "Height" column in the DataFrames
ax.boxplot([mens_rowing["Height"], mens_gymnastics["Height"]])

# Add x-axis tick labels:
ax.set_xticklabels(["Rowing", "Gymnastics"])

# Add a y-axis label

Simple scatter plot
Scatter are a bi-variate visualization technique. They plot each record in the data as a point. The location of each point is determined by the value of two variables: the first variable determines the distance along the x-axis and the second variable determines the height along the y-axis.

In this exercise, you will create a scatter plot of the climate_change data. This DataFrame, which is already loaded, has a column "co2" that indicates the measurements of carbon dioxide every month and another column, "relative_temp" that indicates the temperature measured at the same time.
'''
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Add data: "co2" on x-axis, "relative_temp" on y-axis
ax.scatter(climate_change['co2'], climate_change['relative_temp'])

# Set the x-axis label to "CO2 (ppm)"
ax.set_xlabel("CO2 (ppm)")

# Set the y-axis label to "Relative temperature (C)"
ax.set_ylabel("Relative temperature (C)")

plt.show()

#Color time series
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Add data: "co2", "relative_temp" as x-y, index as color
ax.scatter(climate_change["co2"], climate_change["relative_temp"], c=climate_change.index)

# Set the x-axis label to "CO2 (ppm)"
ax.set_xlabel("CO2 (ppm)")

# Set the y-axis label to "Relative temperature (C)"
ax.set_ylabel("Relative temperature (C)")

plt.show()


#Example of box plotting

# Use the "ggplot" style and create new Figure/Axes
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
plt.style.use("ggplot")
ax.plot(seattle_weather["MONTH"], seattle_weather["MLY-TAVG-NORMAL"])
plt.show()


'''
Automate your visualization
One of the main strengths of Matplotlib is that it can be automated to 
adapt to the data that it receives as input. For example, if you receive 
data that has an unknown number of categories,
 you can still create a bar plot that has bars for each category.

fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Loop over the different sports branches
for sport in sports:
  # Extract the rows only for this sport
  sport_df = summer_2016_medals[summer_2016_medals["Sport"] == sport]
  # Add a bar for the "Weight" mean with std y error bar
  ax.bar(sport, sport_df["Weight"].mean(), yerr=sport_df["Weight"].std())

ax.set_ylabel("Weight")
ax.set_xticklabels(sports, rotation=90)

# Save the figure to file
